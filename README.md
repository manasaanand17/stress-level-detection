# stress-level-detection
This project focuses on developing a system that can detect stress levels based on the user's sleeping cycle position. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the user's sleeping posture and correlate it with their stress levels. The project includes the following sleeping cycle positions:

Log Position: The user sleeps on their back with their arms at their sides.
Fetal Position: The user sleeps on their side with their knees bent and their arms curled in front of them.
Starfish Position: The user sleeps on their back with their arms and legs spread out.
Freefall Position: The user sleeps on their stomach with their arms extended in front of them.
