# **<center><font style="color:rgb(100,109,254)">Real-Time 3D Pose Detection & Pose Classification with Mediapipe and Python</font> </center>**

Pose Detection (also known as Pose Estimation) is a widely used computer vision task that enables you to predict humans poses in images or videos by localizing the key body joints (also reffered  as landmarks), these are elbows, shoulders, and knees, etc.

<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1hT-lhDvzft8vVQv6ObSok73h7A4l5CXf'>


[MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html) provides a robust solution capable of predicting **thirty-three 3D landmarks** on a human body in real-time with high accuracy even on CPU. It utilizes a two-step machine learning pipeline, by using a detector it first localizes the person within the frame and then uses the pose landmarks detector to predict the  landmarks within the region of interest.

For the videos, the detector is used only for the very first frame and then the ROI is derived from the previous frameâ€™s pose landmarks using a tracking method. Also when the tracker loses track of the identify body pose presence in a frame, the detector is invoked again for the next frame which reduces the computation and latency. The image below shows the thirty-three pose landmarks along with their indexes.

Let's start by importing the required libraries.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

"""## **<font style="color:rgb(134,19,348)">Initialize the Pose Detection Model</font>**

The first thing that we need to do is initialize the pose class using the **`mp.solutions.pose`** syntax and then we will call the setup function **`mp.solutions.pose.Pose()`** with the arguments:

* **`static_image_mode`** - It is a boolean value that is if set to `False`, the detector is only invoked as needed, that is in the very first frame or when the tracker loses track. If set to `True`, the person detector is invoked on every input image. So you should probably set this value to True when working with a bunch of unrelated images not videos. Its default value is `False`.

* **`min_detection_confidence`** - It is the minimum detection confidence with range `(0.0 , 1.0)` required to consider the person-detection model's prediction correct. Its default value is `0.5`. This means if the detector has a prediction confidence of greater or equal to 50% then it will be considered as a positive detection.


* **`min_tracking_confidence`** - It is the minimum tracking confidence `([0.0, 1.0])` required to consider the landmark-tracking model's tracked pose landmarks valid. If the confidence is less than the set value then the detector is invoked again in the next frame/image, so increasing its value increases the robustness, but also increases the latency. Its default value is `0.5`.


* **`model_complexity`** - It is the complexity of the pose landmark model. As there are three different models to choose from so the possible values are `0`, `1`, or `2`. The higher the value, the more accurate the results are, but at the expense of higher latency. Its default value is `1`.


* **`smooth_landmarks`** - It is a boolean value that is if set to `True`, pose landmarks across different frames are filtered to reduce noise. But only works when **`static_image_mode`** is also set to `False`. Its default value is `True`.

Then we will also initialize **`mp.solutions.drawing_utils`** class that will allow us to visualize the landmarks after detection, instead of using this, you can also use OpenCV to visualize the landmarks.

Now we will pass the image to the pose detection machine learning pipeline by using the function **`mp.solutions.pose.Pose().process()`**. But the pipeline expects the input images in **`RGB`** color format so first we will have to convert the sample image from **`BGR`** to **`RGB`** format using the function [**`cv2.cvtColor()`**](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html#ga397ae87e1288a81d2363b61574eb8cab) as OpenCV reads images in **`BGR`** format (instead of **`RGB`**).

After performing the pose detection, we will get a list of thirty-three landmarks representing the body joint locations of the prominent person in the image. Each landmark has:

* **`x`** - It is the landmark x-coordinate normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image width.


* **`y`**: It is the landmark y-coordinate normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image height.


* **`z`**: It is the landmark z-coordinate normalized to roughly the same scale as **`x`**. It represents the landmark depth with midpoint of hips being the origin, so the smaller the value of z, the closer the landmark is to the camera.

* **`visibility`**: It is a value with range [0.0, 1.0] representing the possibility of the landmark being visible (not occluded) in the image. This is a useful variable when deciding if you want to show a particular joint because it might be occluded or partially visible in the image.

After performing the pose detection on the sample image above, we will display the first two landmarks from the list, so that you get a better idea of the output of the model.

## **<font style="color:rgb(134,19,348)">Pose Classification with Angle Heuristics</font>**

We have learned to perform pose detection, now we will level up our game by also classifying different yoga poses using the calculated angles of various joints. We will first detect the pose landmarks and then use them to compute angles between joints and depending upon those angles we will recognize the yoga pose of the prominent person in an image.

But this approach does have a drawback that limits its use to a controlled environment, the calculated angles vary with the angle between the person and the camera. So the person needs to be facing the camera straight to get the best results.

The first point (landmark) is considered as the starting point of the first line, the second point (landmark) is considered as the ending point of the first line and the starting point of the second line as well, and the third point (landmark) is considered as the ending point of the second line.

* Around 35Â° (if right knee) or 335Â° (if left knee) angle at the other knee
